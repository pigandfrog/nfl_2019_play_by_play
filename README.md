Are NFL teams predictable in the type of plays that they call?  Are some teams more predictable than other teams and does it matter?  This repository contains a notebook where nfl play by play data is used to create a model to predict the types of play, (a pass or run).  The data used is from 2016 to 2019.  A model hat was trained is used in a nfl_play_predictor [app](https://nfl-plays-predictor.herokuapp.com/).
